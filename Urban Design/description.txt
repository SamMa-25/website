Urban Design: Pvd West End Container Housing Project
====================================================

DESIGN PROCESS & METHODOLOGY

This project demonstrates a comprehensive urban design process that prioritizes community engagement, sustainable practices, and adaptive reuse. The design methodology emphasizes iterative development, from initial site analysis through final implementation.

DESIGN PROCESS:

1. SITE ANALYSIS & COMMUNITY RESEARCH
- Comprehensive study of West End's industrial history and community needs
- Analysis of existing building conditions and potential for adaptive reuse
- Identification of key intersection at Fuller St and Warren St as focal point
- Mapping of pedestrian circulation patterns and community spaces

2. CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT
- Development of container-based modular housing system
- Integration of greenhouse programming for food production
- Creation of flexible public-private space relationships
- Design of cohesive pedestrian experience connecting community spaces

3. PHYSICAL MODELING & ITERATION
- Hands-on exploration through physical mass models and site studies
- Tactile modeling of container configurations and site relationships
- Iterative refinement of spatial arrangements and circulation patterns
- Community feedback sessions and physical testing

4. COMMUNITY INTEGRATION STRATEGY
- Design as catalyst for community cooperation rather than end goal
- Integration with existing urban fabric and historical context
- Creation of adaptable spaces that support community resilience
- Development of sustainable material and construction practices

DESIGN APPROACH:
- Physical modeling for hands-on design exploration
- Tactile iteration through mass models and site studies
- Sustainable material reuse and container repurposing
- Community-centered design methodology

KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Adaptive reuse of existing structures and materials
- Community-driven spatial organization
- Sustainable construction and material practices
- Integration of production, housing, and community spaces
- Flexible, resilient design for changing community needs
