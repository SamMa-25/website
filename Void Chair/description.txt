PROJECT DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE
============================

Project Name: [Void Chair]

Description:
created during
my senior year exchange in Co-
penhagen. The project was in-
spired by visits to and studies
of the renowned Danish design
studios of Arne Jacobsen and
Fritz Hansen. It embodies the
essence of Scandinavian de-
sign, merging meticulous crafts-
manship traditions with the
grand industrial functionality
and rationalist style. I sought to
blend my own experiences and
background to the fullest.

The work aims to convey a sense of spir-
ituality in the act of sitting. The elastic
cord underneath provides a strange yet
comforting sensation of buoyancy and un-
certainty, mirroring how modern society
often places us in unfamiliar, uncharted
states that we accept without question
or acknowledgment. It serves as both an
expression of and a critique of how we,
as individuals, are perpetually navigating
the unknown, surrendering to the pres-
ent moment without fully recognizing the
strangeness of our surroundings.
